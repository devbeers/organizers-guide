# Team Requirements

Besides individual requirements, we recommend that each city has at least 3-4 organizers. We found that to be the best number for a few reasons such as:

- It's easier to divide the work so it's more fun
- It's not too many people that tasks end up not being done, or everything falls to one person
- Things happen and if one or two organizers have less free time during a month, the other organizers can still put together a great event
- You can have a mix of organizers with more and less experience organizing events
