# Location

Here are some tips when searching for a location to host a devbeers!

First thing you should know, you can probably get a space for free. Since the event will usually bring around 50 people to a pub/bar, you can usually negotiate any fees that the place might have for just getting in, or even get discounts on the price of the beer.

## Finding a place:
- [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) and [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/) are great for making a list of good places to look into.
- Ask friends using Facebok/Twitter.

## Requirements:
- Prefer pubs. They'll usually have a more open space with high tables/chairs that make it better for people to mingle. If pubs are not an option, look for bars that might have reserved spaces, or that might be willing to take some of the tables and chairs out of the event space.
- Places that have individual tabs. Makes it a whole lot easier for people to pay for their own drinks and food.
- Located near a subway station, or an easily accessible area.

## Negotiation:
- There's a couple things that you can negotiate, considering the fact that the event brings around 50 people to the place during a weekday:
    - Try to negotiate any fees that the place might have for people to enter.
    - Try to negotiate the price of the beer.
