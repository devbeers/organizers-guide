## Code of Conduct

We understand how important it is to have a Code of Conduct for any type of event, and that we can help create a safe, harassment-free environment, and also help our community in doing so.

On our website you can find the [code of conduct](http://www.devbeers.io/codeofconduct/) for the event. **It's important that all organizers, participants and sponsors follow it.**
