# Event Details

This is a more detailed description of how the event works.

## Date/Location

The event happens monthly, and the day might vary in-between cities. It happens on Wednesday in SÃ£o Paulo, and on Thursday in Belo Horizonte, for example. It's up to the organizers in each city to figure out what the best day for the event is, taking into account a few points:

- Bar/pubs need to be a little emptier to make it easier to book any reservations.
- Preferrably no big events or regular meetups from other communities happen on that day (conflicts will always happen, but looking into it before scheduling anything makes everyone happier :)).

**The best days will usually end up being between Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday from our experience.**

After the organizers choose a weekday, we'll usually try to have the event on that last weekday of the month, so the organizers have more time to set things in motion.

The bar/pub may also vary in-between months. We do this for a couple reasons:

- Changing locations helps bring different people that might work or live closer to the event. This is especially helpful in big cities.
- It's fun to get to know different places!

## Schedule

#### 07h00

The event starts at 7h30pm, so it's best if the organizers arrive around 7pm. Talk to the bar manager, figure out how the beer distribution is gonna work (beer tickets, individual tabs, etc), set up the space in case you need to move tables/chairs, set any swag on table (stickers, t-shirts).

**Tip:** It's easier to pay for the beer when you arrive

#### 07h30

Event starts, welcome everyone that arrives and check them in. Make sure to ask if that's the participant's first time at the event, and explain to them how it works.

#### 09h00

Call participants attention (microphone, yelling) and:

- The organizers introduce themselves
- Thanks all the participants for coming
- Open space for all the sponsors to give a quick message (maximum of 2 minutes)
- Any swag giveaways
- Open space for message or giveaways from developer communities :)

#### 11h00

Event end! It usually ends around 11pm (or 4am sometimes). Remember to pack the banner, make sure that the beer is paid for, and to thank the bar manager.

## Price

The event is free! Participants can sign up for free on the page of the event, and there's a fixed amount of free beer that they can enjoy which depends on the number of sponsors. Any other item like soda, or food, is paid separately by each participant.
