Our goal is short and simple:

> Our mission is to unite developers from all communities

With devbeers we're trying to have a monthly event throughout the world, where developers from all different communities can gather and chat, about new technologies, languages, frameworks, etc. 

Our goals are to:

- Have a safe environment for all people in the community
- Gather people from different communities (Developers, DevOps, SCRUM Masters, JavaScript, Ruby, C#, Java, Swift, etc)
- Showcase and promote other community initiatives
