# FAQ

### Can the event happen in a place other than a pub/bar?

Maybe. The reasons why we don't do event outside of pub/bars is to avoid adding more work/stress/headaches to the organizers, who are already doing this for free. Doing the event outside of a pub/bar requires:

- A place to store and cool the beer
- Ordering the beer
- Figuring out how to provide food for the participants
- Potentially helping serve both of the above
- Cleaning up afterwards

This doesn't mean we might not eventually do a devbeers outside of a pub/bar, but we haven't done one yet.
