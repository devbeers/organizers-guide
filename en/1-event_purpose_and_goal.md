# Event Purpose and Goal

## What is the goal of devbeers?

Our goal is short and simple:

> Our mission is to unite developers from all communities

We do that by organizing a monthly event in multiple cities throughout the world, where developers from all different communities can gather and chat, about new technologies, languages, frameworks, etc. 

Our goals are to:

- Gather people from different communities (Developers, DevOps, SCRUM Masters, JavaScript, Ruby, C#, Java, Swift, etc).
- Have a safe environment for all the people in the community to come together.
- Showcase and promote other community initiatives.

## How the event works

The event has a simple format: it's free to sign up and participants get free beers (paid by awesome sponsors, soda and food not included). It's monthly and always during a weekday, starting at 7h30pm.

The focus is on developers, and that will always be the majority of people in the event, but we welcome people from other areas as well. There's no need for a laptop (unless you wanna program during the event which is absolutely fine), and there's no presentation or talks.
