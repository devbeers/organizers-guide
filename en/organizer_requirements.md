# Organizer Requirements

The requirements to become a **devbeers** organizer are:

- Be a developer
- Read and follow the Code of Conduct
- Have about 2 hours every week to help with the organization
- Have participated in a devbeers before*

The last one might be a little bit hard considering we only have the event in a small number of cities, so it's more of a big +1. It also helps if you've been involved in the organization of other meetups or conferences in your community.

There'll also be a call via Hangout when organizers first join to help with the onboarding and answer any questions.
