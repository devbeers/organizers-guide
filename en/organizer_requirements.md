# Organizer Requirements

The requirements to become a devbeers organizer are:

- Be a developer
- Have about 2 hours every week to help with the organization
- Have participated in a devbeers before*

The last one might be a little bit hard considering we only have the event in a small number of cities, so it's more of a big +1. It also helps if you've been involved in the organization of other meetups or conferences in your community.
