# Location

Here are some tips when searching for a location to host a devbeers!

First thing you should know, you can probably get a space for free. Since the event will usually bring around 50 people to a pub/bar, you can usually negotiate any fees that the place might have for just getting in, or even get discounts on the price of the beer.

The bar/pub may also vary in-between months. We do this for a couple reasons:

- Changing locations helps bring different people that might work or live closer to the event. This is especially helpful in big cities.
- It's fun to get to know different places!

## Finding a place:
- [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) and [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/) are great for making a list of good places to look into.
- Ask friends using Facebok/Twitter.

## Requirements:
- Prefer pubs. They'll usually have a more open space with high tables/chairs that make it better for people to mingle. If pubs are not an option, look for bars that might have reserved spaces, or that might be willing to take some of the tables and chairs out of the event space.
- Places that have individual tabs. Makes it a whole lot easier for people to pay for their own drinks and food.
- Located near a subway station, or an easily accessible area.

## Negotiation:
- There's a couple things that you can negotiate, considering the fact that the event brings around 50 people to the place during a weekday:
    - Try to negotiate any fees that the place might have for people to enter.
    - Try to negotiate the price of the beer.
    
## Questions to ask the bar manager:

- What's the name of the manager?
- What's the name of the person that makes the reservation (if it's not the manager)?
- Do they have an email and/or phone number?
- How many people can fit in the bar?
- Do they make reservations?
    - If they do:
        - What's the maximum number of people for a reservation?
        - What time do we need to arrive?
    - If they don't:
        - What's the busiest days? Is it busy on the day you're planning the event?
- Is there a separate space (different floor or area) for events?
- Do they close the bar depending on the size of the event?
- Is there a fee just to get in the bar (if there's a band playing, for example)?
- Can we put up a banner?
- Do you have individual tabs for groups?
- What's the price of the beer? And brands?
- Do you have a small stage, and/or projectors, and/or microphones?
