# Organizer Requirements

The requirements to become a **devbeers** organizer are:

- Be a developer
- Read and follow the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.html)
- Have about 2 hours every week to help with the organization

+1's (not necessary!):
- Have organized other meetups or conferences
- Have participated in a devbeers before*

The last one might be a little bit hard considering we only have the event in a small number of cities right now, so it's more of a big +1 if you have it.

If you don't have experience organizing events, but you want to organize a devbeers, you can! We have a lot of people from other cities that would be happy to help you, and also started out with no experience. :)

There'll also be a call via Hangout when organizers first join to help with the onboarding and to answer any questions.
