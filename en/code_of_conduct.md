## Code of Conduct

We understand how important it is to have a Code of Conduct for any type of event, and that we can help create a safe, harassment-free environment, and also help our community in doing so.

Below you'll find an English version of our Code of Conduct. Special thanks to [Tropical Ruby](http://tropicalrb.com/) for allowing us to use their [Code of Conduct](http://tropicalrb.com/en/code-of-conduct/).


### Code of Conduct - English

devbeers is dedicated to provide a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion or political view. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery targeted on any specific group or person is not appropriate for event venues, including talks. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event, without refunds, at the discretion of the event organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion or political view, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Organizers and sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, both should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Also, they should not use sexualized clothing or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
