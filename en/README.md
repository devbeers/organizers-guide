# devbeers - Organizer's Guide

Welcome to devbeers Organizer's Guide!

This is a [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) containing all information that organizers might need to make an awesome event.

Organizing events can be a lot of work, but it can also be really rewarding and a lot of fun. This guide is made to help you along the way and make it as easy as possible for you to put together everything needed for a great experience. 

**We recommend every organizer reads this guide at least once, so it can more easily be referenced later on.**

## The topics that we'll cover are:

- [What is the purpose and goal of the event](event_purpose_and_goal.html)
- How to find co-organizers
- [How to find/choose a place](6-location.html)
- [What to do during the event](7-event_day.html)
- [FAQ](8-faq.html)
