# Starting a devbeers in your city

We're still figuring out the process of how we're gonna expand the event!

So far, we're asking organizers interested in bringing devbeers to their city to open an issue on GitHub with the name of their city, for example:

https://github.com/devbeers/devbeers.github.io/issues/18

That way we can see the feedback and interest from the community to start an event in that city, and decide what to do from then on. :)
