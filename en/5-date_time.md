# Choosing a Date & Time

## Date

One of the most important things when starting a meetup is *consistency*. And a big part of that is choosing a weekday and week of the month.

The day the event happens might vary in-between cities, and it's up to the organizers to choose what they think it's best. A few points you should consider when deciding the dates are:

- Bar/pubs need to be a little emptier to make it easier to book reservations. That will also make it easier to negotiate a good deal with the bar for food and drinks discounts.
- Preferrably no big events or regular meetups from other communities happen on that day (conflicts will always happen, but looking into it before scheduling anything makes everyone happier!).

From our experience, **the best days usually end up being between Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.** A easy way to figure that out is to do a quick search on Foursquare, or just call bars in your neighborhood, and ask them which days they're open, and which ones they're emptier.

After the organizers choose a weekday, what we have found that works best, is having the event on that last weekday of the month. That way, they have the whole month to set things up.

## Time

The event will usually start at 7h30pm, and go until about 10h30pm-11pm. That can vary a lot between different cities and cultures, so the overall recommendation is to have it start 1-1h30 hours after the workday ends, and it should last about 3-4 hours.
